My personal site<br>
https://www.leonid.app<br>
(still doing cross-browser / mobile testing / waiting for DNS)

This is my personal hub. Features many components I build from scratch for practice and fun.<br>
I'm always testing out things and working out kinks so bear with me.

Upcoming features:<br>
<pre>
	Progressive Web App version<br>
	Fancy biography section<br>
	Feedback system (star rating / comments)<br>
	Dark / Light theme button<br>
	Social media feed integration<br>
</pre>

Thanks for checking my site out! Please message me with any questions, requests or suggestions!
