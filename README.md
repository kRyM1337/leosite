My personal site
http://morning-eyrie-12815.herokuapp.com/ 
(live on limited Heroku for now - still doing cross-browser / mobile testing)

This is my personal hub. Features many components I build from scratch for practice and fun.
I'm always testing out things and working out kinks so bear with me.

Upcoming features:
	Progressive Web App version
	Fancy biography section
	Feedback system (star rating / comments)
	Dark / Light theme button
	Social media feed integration

Thanks for checking my site out! Please message me with any questions, requests or suggestions!
