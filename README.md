This is my personal hub. Features many components I build from scratch for practice and fun.<br>
I'm always testing out things and working out kinks so bear with me.

Things I picked up while working on this site:<br>

<pre>
	CSS3 / Flexbox / Grid / Animations<br>
	Responsive Design<br>
	NodeJS / NPM<br>
	API Patterns<br>
	SQLite3<br>
	HTML5
</pre>

Future things:<br>
<pre>
	Progressive Web App version<br>
	Fancy biography section<br>
	Feedback system (star rating / comments)<br>
	Dark / Light theme button<br>
	Social media feed integration<br>
</pre>

Thanks for checking my site out! Please message me with any questions, requests or suggestions!<br>

P.S. Feel free to borrow or remix any components / features you find on this site! I learned a lot from other coders on the web so it's only fair one day somebody else will learn from me :)
