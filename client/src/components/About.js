            I am a Content Specialist and Frontend Developer with experience in content management, web development and
            some design. I am passionate about information architecture, creative user interfaces and interactions.
            While I am growing my modern web development practice, my main career goal is to work in the Web Content
            space, leveraging my past experience with my new Web Development experience including various CMS and CDN
            (i.e. Strapi CMS, Contentful, Netlify).
            <br />
            <br />
            Modern businesses require a modern content direction, leveraging the power of Content Delivery Networks and
            API-first Content Management Systems. I wish to help people succeed in this area while working with fellow
            developers, designers and content managers. I am always happy and willing to learn new things and push the
            envelope!
            <br />
            <br />
            If my goals sound interesting to you, I am currently open to full-time, contract and freelance positions
            remotely or in the NJ / NYC / Philadelphia area.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks for your time,
            <br />
