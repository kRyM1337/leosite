            I am a Full Stack Software Developer passionate about Front-End technologies and Web Architectures. In my
            late teens I got into computer building, video games, music production and photography-inspired art. Later
            on I decided to align my creativity with Software Engineering when my first daughter was born. I studied at
            Arizona State's strong SE program. I learned the ins and outs of the SDLC, OS & Networks, Computer Science
            fundamentals and other aspects of software engineering and design. Close to graduation I realized my
            interests and passions align in web development and the future is truly exciting.

            Presently I enjoy working on projects in the Javascript, Node & React eco-system, with a growing fondness
            for the JAMstack and static site generators. One of my main missions is to create a future web experience
            that is more lively and animated. With those goals in mind, I plan on learning and utilizing technologies
            like GreenSock, Pixi.js, Phaser, Web AR/VR and more, while leveraging the immense reusability of the modern
            web components community.
