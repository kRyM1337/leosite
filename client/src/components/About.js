         <p>
            I am a Frontend Developer from Arizona Stateâ€™s Software Engineering program with experience in web
            development, design and deployment. I am passionate about creating interesting and functional web
            experiences while continuously expanding my knowledge base and learning new techniques, best practices and
            methodologies. My passions are in web development, web animation and interactions. I have knowledge and
            experience in Javascript, Node, React, CSS3/ HTML5, GSAP, Adobe Suite and the dev tools that go along with
            modern web experiences.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently I am solidifying my skills through personal projects and freelance clients until I find a
            favorable full-time position. One of my main missions is to create a future web experience that is more
            lively and animated. With those goals in mind, I plan on learning and utilizing technologies like Pixi.js,
            Phaser, Web AR/VR and more, while leveraging the immense reusability of the modern web components community.
            I am open to full-time, contract or freelance positions remotely or in the NJ / NYC / Philadelphia area.
